Enumerative geometry (5 weeks)

Disclaimer 1: algebraic setup (Chow ring) instead of topological setup (singular cohomology).
Disclaimer 2: talks should ideally be rather informal and with plenty of pictures, so that a background in algebraic geometry is not necessary to follow the geometric ideas.

1. The Chow ring
- Briefly recall algebraic and projective varieties (informally).
- Define rational equivalence (suggested picture: [1.2]). Remark that it agrees with linear equivalence for divisors [1.10].
- Define transversality and state the moving lemma [1.6] (suggested picture: [1.4]). Define ring structure on Chow group [1.5].
- Define fundamental class and explain [1.8.b].
- Compute Chow group of affine n-space [1.13] (suggested picture: [1.7])

2. Computational tools
- Briefly recall rational equivalence of cycles (suggested picture: top part of [1.8]) and definition of Chow ring.
- Prove excision [1.14.b].
- Prove Mayer--Vietoris [1.14.a]
- Discuss affine stratifications and explain [1.17].
- Briefly discuss proper pushforward [1.20] (suggested picture: [1.8]) and the degree map [1.21].
- Briefly discuss flat pullback [1.25] and state the projection formula [1.23.b].
- Compute Chow ring of projective n-space [2.1].

3. First enumerative results
- Briefly recall computation of Chow ring of projective n-space [2.1].
- How many intersection points between two curves in projective plane? (BÃ©zout's theorem [2.4])
- How many lines passing through a point are tangent to a given cubic? (Sketch subsection [2.1.3], suggested picture: [2.2])
- How many circles tangent to three given circles? (The circles of Apollonius, sketch section [2.3])

4. Grassmannians
- Discuss subsections [3.2.1], [3.2.2], [3.2.3] and [3.2.4], including the Euler sequence on projective n-space (suggested picture: [3.1]).

5. How many lines pass through four given lines in space?
- Sketch the computation of the Chow ring of the Grassmannian of lines in projective 3-space, drawing pictures of Schubert cycles (suggested picture: [3.3]).
- Solve the question in the title and explain the geometry behind it (suggested pictures: [3.7] and [3.8]).
